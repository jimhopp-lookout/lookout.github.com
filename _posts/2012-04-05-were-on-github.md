At [Lookout](https://lookout.com/about/careers) we use a *lot* of open source
software throughout engineering.

Being hackers at heart, we also have a lot of [gems](http://rubygems.org),
libraries, scripts and other things that we want to share with the world. To
that end you can now find us [on GitHub](https://github.com/lookout).

We're still in the process of moving more code onto this public facing GitHub
account, so don't let some of the current sparseness disappoint you too much.
